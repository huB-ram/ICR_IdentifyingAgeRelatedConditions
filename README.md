## Goal of the Competition
The goal of this competition is to predict if a person has any of three medical conditions. You are being asked to predict if the person has one or more of any of the three medical conditions (Class 1), or none of the three medical conditions (Class 0). You will create a model trained on measurements of health characteristics.

To determine if someone has these medical conditions requires a long and intrusive process to collect information from patients. With predictive models, we can shorten this process and keep patient details private by collecting key characteristics relative to the conditions, then encoding these characteristics.

Your work will help researchers discover the relationship between measurements of certain characteristics and potential patient conditions.

## Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated using a balanced logarithmic loss. The overall effect is such that each class is roughly equally important for the final score.

Each observation is either of class 0 or of class 1. For each observation, you must submit a probability for each class. The formula is then:

where (N_{c}) is the number of observations of class (c), (\log) is the natural logarithm, (y_{c i}) is 1 if observation (i) belongs to class (c) and 0 otherwise, (p_{c i}) is the predicted probability that observation (i) belongs to class (c).

The submitted probabilities for a given row are not required to sum to one because they are rescaled prior to being scored (each row is divided by the row sum). In order to avoid the extremes of the log function, each predicted probability ùëù
 is replaced with max(min(ùëù,1‚àí10‚àí15),10‚àí15).
